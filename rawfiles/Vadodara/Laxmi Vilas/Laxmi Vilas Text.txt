when Laxmi Vilas Palace was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III,
 it was the largest private dwelling unit in the world.
Does that give an idea of its size? The palace compound covers an area of more than 700 acres,
 and houses several other buildings such as the Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum and the Moti Baug Palace. 
What is worth a look, 
when not being awed by the sheer opulence of the place,
 is the collection of sculptures and armory in marble,
 terracotta and bronze that are strewn across the palace.
 Although it is still the residence of the royal family of Vadodara,
 it is open to the public for visits and is one of the most famous tourist places in Gujarat.
